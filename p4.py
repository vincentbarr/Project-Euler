# Problem 4: Largest Palindrome Product
# A palindromic number reads the same both ways.
# The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# Smallest 3 digit number: 100
# Largest 3 digit number: 999
# Answer is 5 - 6 digits
# Since the number cannot start with 0, it cannot end with 0
# Therefore, it is not divisible by 10. 
# So, the three digit numbers are [1-9][0-9][1-9], 810 possibilities.
